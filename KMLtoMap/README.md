#To create Infill or Line maps from KMZ

1. Open KMZ in google earth
2. Right click on the polygon or line element you wish to convert and click Save As
3. Save the element as a **.KML** file in the directory of `KMLtoMap.exe`
4. Launch `KMLtoMap.exe` and follow the prompts. Refer to https://github.com/sawbe/vatsys-australia-dataset Maps README for answers to prompts.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for other desired elements.
5. Merge the separate XML files generated into the one desired `<Map>` (again, refer to https://github.com/sawbe/vatsys-australia-dataset)
